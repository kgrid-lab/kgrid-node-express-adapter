This guide will demonstrate how to create a Knowledge Object (KO) for the KGrid Node Runtime. Please refer to KGrid [Knowledge Object Common Model](https://kgrid.org/specs) for more details of KO.

The instructions will utilize [KGrid CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kgrid/cli) and assume that the reader is familiar with the generic KO creation process described in [Developer's Guide](https://kgrid.org/guides/develoer/)
